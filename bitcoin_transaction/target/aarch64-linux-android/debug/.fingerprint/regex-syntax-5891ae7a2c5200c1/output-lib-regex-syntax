More information\n  about x.py is available in the [rustc-dev-guide].\n\n[rustc-dev-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/how-to-build-and-run.html#building-the-compiler\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/Users/haykpetrosyan/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/regex-syntax-0.8.3/src/utf8.rs","byte_start":2903,"byte_end":2907,"line_start":83,"line_end":83,"column_start":5,"column_end":9,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"use core::{char, fmt, iter::FusedIterator, slice};","highlight_start":5,"highlight_end":9}],"label":"can't find crate","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"the `aarch64-linux-android` target may not be installed","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"consider downloading the target with `rustup target add aarch64-linux-android`","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0463]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: can't find crate for `core`\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0m/Users/haykpetrosyan/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/regex-syntax-0.8.3/src/utf8.rs:83:5\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m83\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0muse core::{char, fmt, iter::FusedIterator, slice};\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mcan't find crate\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m= \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1mnote\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: the `aarch64-linux-android` target may not be installed\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m= \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1mhelp\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: consider downloading the target with `rustup target add aarch64-linux-android`\u001b[0m\n\n"}

An\nexample that causes this error is below:\n\n```compile_fail,E0412\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nmod foo {\n    fn some_function(f: File) {}\n}\n```\n\n```\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nmod foo {\n    // either\n    use super::File;\n    // or\n    // use std::fs::File;\n    fn foo(f: File) {}\n}\n# fn main() {} // don't insert it for us; that'll break imports\n```\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/Users/haykpetrosyan/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/regex-syntax-0.8.3/src/hir/literal.rs","byte_start":86893,"byte_end":86899,"line_start":2268,"line_end":2268,"column_start":43,"column_end":49,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    fn insert(&mut self, bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<usize, usize> {","highlight_start":43,"highlight_end":49}],"label":"not found in this scope","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"these type aliases exist but are inaccessible","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[{"file_name":"/Users/haykpetrosyan/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/regex-syntax-0.8.3/src/ast/parse.rs","byte_start":341,"byte_end":394,"line_start":24,"line_end":24,"column_start":1,"column_end":54,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"type Result<T> = core::result::Result<T, ast::Error>;","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":54}],"label":"`crate::ast::parse::Result`: not accessible","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"/Users/haykpetrosyan/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/regex-syntax-0.8.3/src/hir/translate.rs","byte_start":314,"byte_end":362,"line_start":16,"line_end":16,"column_start":1,"column_end":49,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"type Result<T> = core::result::Result<T, Error>;","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":49}],"label":"`crate::hir::translate::Result`: not accessible","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0412]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: cannot find type `Result` in this scope\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0m/Users/haykpetrosyan/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/regex-syntax-0.8.3/src/hir/literal.rs:2268:43\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m     \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m2268\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m    fn insert(&mut self, bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<usize, usize> {\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m     \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                          \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mnot found in this scope\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m     \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;10mnote\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: these type aliases exist but are inaccessible\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0m/Users/haykpetrosyan/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/regex-syntax-0.8.3/src/ast/parse.rs:24:1\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m     \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m24\u001b[0m\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0mtype Result<T> = core::result::Result<T, ast::Error>;\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m     \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;10m^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;10m`crate::ast::parse::Result`: not accessible\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m     \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m::: \u001b[0m\u001b[0m/Users/haykpetrosyan/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/regex-syntax-0.8.3/src/hir/translate.rs:16:1\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m     \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m16\u001b[0m\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0mtype Result<T> = core::result::Result<T, Error>;\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m     \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;10m^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;10m`crate::hir::translate::Result`: not accessible\u001b[0m\n\n"}
